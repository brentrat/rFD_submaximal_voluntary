% The order that is provided as input to this function will be honoured when

% 2nd order filter will be generated by dual passing a 1st order filter.
% Uneven filter order are therefore not possible, if a uneven filter order
% is provided as input to this function a filter will be designed to the
% next even number. For example, if order = 3, then a 2nd order filter will
% be dual passed, resulting in a 4th order.

% -------- Description: --------
% This function corrects the cut-off frequency and order for passing the
% data through a Butterworth filter twice. Dual pass filtering is performed for the
% following reason: The Buterworth  
% filter creates time delays or phase lags that are not consistent across
% the frequency range after the data is passed through the filter.
% Therefore, a simple shift of the filtered data in time would not suffice
% as a correction. To compensate for these delays, it is common to pass the
% data through the filter again but in reverse, also referred to as
% dual-pass zero-lag or zero-phase shift filtering. However, because the
% data is filtered twice (once in each direction), the selectivity (order)
% of the filter changes and additional power is removed from the signal.
% With each filter pass, the cut-off frequency (the frequency at which the
% amplitude of the data is reduced to ~70.7% or -3dB) is pushed towards
% lower or higher frequencies, depending if the filter is designed to
% filter out high (low-pass filter) or low (high-pass filter) frequencies,
% respectively.
